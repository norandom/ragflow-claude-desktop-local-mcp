# RAGFlow Claude MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides seamless integration between Claude Desktop and RAGFlow's REST API for knowledge base querying and document management.

## Features

- **Enhanced Result Control**: Fine-tuned control over query results with `top_n` (default: 10) and `similarity_threshold` (default: 0.2) parameters
- **Cross-Language Queries**: Built-in support for multilingual queries with English and German as defaults
- **Context7 Integration**: Leverages Context7 for up-to-date documentation and cross-language searches
- **Automatic Session Management**: Sessions are automatically created and reused per dataset
- **Dataset Name Lookup**: Query knowledge bases using familiar names instead of cryptic IDs
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Find datasets with partial name matches (case-insensitive)
- **Session Persistence**: Conversation context is maintained across queries
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Clear error messages and dataset suggestions
- **Multiple Query Methods**: Support for both ID-based and name-based queries
- **Improved Query Quality**: Increased default result limit from 1 to 10 chunks for better responses

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/norandom/ragflow-claude-desktop-local-mcp
   cd ragflow-claude-desktop-local-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

## Result Control and Filtering

### Enhanced Query Parameters
The server now supports fine-tuned control over query results:

- **`top_n`**: Controls the number of document chunks fed to the LLM (default: 10, previously 1)
- **`similarity_threshold`**: Filters chunks based on relevance score (default: 0.2, range: 0.0-1.0)

### Result Optimization Tips
- **For broader results**: Use `top_n=15` and `similarity_threshold=0.15`
- **For precise results**: Use `top_n=5` and `similarity_threshold=0.4`
- **For comprehensive analysis**: Use `top_n=20` and `similarity_threshold=0.1`

## Usage Examples

## Technical Details

### Result Control and Optimization
- **Enhanced Query Performance**: Default `top_n` increased from 1 to 10 chunks for more comprehensive responses
- **Similarity Filtering**: `similarity_threshold` parameter filters chunks based on relevance scores (0.0-1.0)
- **Customizable Result Limits**: Both parameters can be adjusted per query for optimal results
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing queries continue to work with improved defaults

### Cross-Language Features
- **Default Languages**: English (`en`) and German (`de`) are set as defaults
- **Context7 Integration**: Leverages Context7 for up-to-date multilingual documentation
- **Enhanced Prompts**: Queries automatically include instructions for multilingual search
- **Language Customization**: Optional `languages` parameter accepts custom language codes
- **Translation Support**: Provides translations and summaries when content is found in different languages

### Session Management
- Each dataset automatically gets a unique session created via RAGFlow's chat API
- Sessions are properly registered with RAGFlow to avoid ownership issues
- Automatic session recovery if ownership errors occur
- Sessions are reused for subsequent queries to maintain conversation context
- Session format: `{session_name}-{timestamp}` or `ragflow-session-{timestamp}`

### Dataset Lookup
- Case-insensitive name matching
- Fuzzy matching for partial names
- Automatic caching of dataset information
- Clear error messages with available dataset suggestions

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages for API failures
- Dataset availability checks
- Automatic session ownership recovery
- Session reset capability for problematic sessions
- Network connectivity issues
- Graceful fallback for session creation failures

## Environment Variables

- `RAGFLOW_BASE_URL`: Base URL of your RAGFlow instance (default: http://192.168.122.93:9380)
- `RAGFLOW_API_KEY`: Your RAGFlow API key (required)

## Development

To run the server directly:

```bash
uv run ragflow-claude-mcp
```

The server will start and listen for MCP requests via stdio.

## Troubleshooting

1. **"Dataset not found" errors**: Use `ragflow_list_datasets` to see available datasets
2. **"You don't own the chat" errors**: The server now automatically handles this by creating new sessions and retrying. If issues persist, use `ragflow_reset_session` to manually clear problematic sessions.
3. **Session ownership issues**: Use `ragflow_reset_session` with the dataset ID to clear the session, then retry your query
4. **Connection errors**: Verify your `RAGFLOW_BASE_URL` and `RAGFLOW_API_KEY` are correct
5. **Server won't start**: Check that all dependencies are installed with `uv install`
6. **Persistent session errors**: Check `ragflow_list_sessions` to see active sessions and reset individual datasets as needed
